How to use the sim:
Show Menu- Opens a menu whith 
  some settngins

  fugured out this one since

How to use the editor:

In the tools box you select
difrent stuff to do:
-Add Node: Creates a new node
  at the cliked position
  The propertys are set from 
  the window below
-Add Node: Creates a new link
  First click a node,then
  click a  node and a link 
  will be created betwen.
  If you have selected the 
  first node and then click 
  on a empty spot a new node 
  will be created and linked 
  (Very useful!)
  The propertys are set from 
  the window below.
-Delete: Deletes the clicked 
  element.Nodes get blue 
  circles.Those are the links
  handels. so select a link 
  you must click that!
-Move: Moves nodes
  To move a node simply click
  and drag it to the desired
  position.
  This tool also have the 
  power to change propertys.
  When you click a elememtn 
  its propertys apear.
  To change them set to what 
  you want and click apply!
  Link handles are displayed
  becuse you can also edit
  link propertys whith it!
  There is also a trick to
  do a stresed link whith 
  it.Insted of using the 
  left mouse button to move
  a node use the right one.
  This will prevent it to
  autoajust link lenths.
  To make them non tense
  simply use the left to 
  move it agen.
